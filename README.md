# Mann-E Flux : The last AI image model you'll test

In the past few months, FLUX models became a trend on the internet and specially the AI community. We, at Mann-E, tried to develop FLUX-inspired models (with similar architecture) and this repository is for tools and codes related to the Mann-E Flux model. 

This model, follows the same architecture as flux and can be used with diffusers and we currently use it in our private systems. Thanks to [RunPod](https://runpod.io) we managed to make this model in less than 48 hours on A100 and H100 GPU's!

## Characteristics of The Model

The model is mostly like your regular FLUX-1[Dev] model, with these differences: 

1. The images used in training, like our _Mann-E Dreams_ model, are from midjourney. So you will have a more "Midjourney like" feel using this model. 
2. The model does the inference in only 8-10 steps (exactly like our Dreams model, we're manouvering on our speed!)
